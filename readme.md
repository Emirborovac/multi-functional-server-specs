### Additional Requirements
- **Peripherals**: Mouse, keyboard, and monitor for local access.
- **Environment**: The server should be in a secure, dust-free, dry room with its own lock to allow for future hardware additions. The server should never be used for desktop or local tasks.

---

## Network Setup

- **ISP Requirements**: Ensure the ISP supports public IP exposure.
- **Dynamic DNS (DynDNS)**: Use DynDNS to update domains if the IP is dynamic.
- **Router Configurations**:
  - Enable DMZ to expose the server.
  - Ensure upload speed matches or exceeds download speed for optimal customer access.

## Security Measures

### System Security

1. **Antivirus**: Use Avast AV Free; premium versions may impede remote access.
2. **Operating System**: Windows Server 2022 with RDP enabled. Note: Licensing is userâ€™s discretion.

### Security Best Practices

#### System Hardening
- **User Management**:
  - Limit user accounts to administrators and service accounts only.
  - Enforce strong passwords and enable MFA for all administrative accounts.
- **Updates**:
  - Schedule automatic updates for Windows Server and other software.
- **Disable Unnecessary Services**:
  - Turn off unused Windows services to reduce the attack surface.
- **Anti-Malware**:
  - Configure Windows Defender or third-party anti-malware software with regular scans.

#### Network Security
- **Firewall Rules**:
  - Allow only essential ports: HTTPS (443), SSH (22 if needed), API-specific ports.
  - Restrict management ports (e.g., RDP on port 3389) to specific IPs or VPN access.
- **DDoS Protection**:
  - Use Cloudflare or similar for DDoS mitigation.
- **VPN Access**:
  - Configure VPN for secure remote connections.

#### Data and API Security
- **Encryption**:
  - Enforce HTTPS for all web and API endpoints.
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2 or 1.3).
- **API Key Management**:
  - Securely manage and rotate API keys regularly.
  - Implement rate limiting and logging for API use to prevent abuse.
- **Database Security**:
  - Enable SSL encryption for database connections.
  - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit data access.

### Logging and Monitoring

- **Event Logging**:
  - Enable Windows Event Logging for system and security events.
  - Log access to critical resources, applications, and databases.
- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - Use Nagios, Zabbix, or Microsoft System Center for health and performance monitoring.
- **Intrusion Detection**:
  - Set up an IDS like Snort or Suricata to detect and respond to malicious activity.

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

- **Automated Backups**: Schedule daily backups to an external location or cloud.
- **Restore Testing**: Regularly test backup restoration to ensure data recovery.
- **Snapshot & Rollback**: Use VM snapshots or enable Windows Backup for rollback options.

## Setup Checklist

### Initial Setup
1. Install Windows Server and complete initial setup.
2. Update system and drivers to the latest versions.
3. Configure RAID for data redundancy (if applicable).

### Software and Role Setup
1. Install IIS/Nginx for website hosting.
2. Set up Python environment with virtual environments per application.
3. Install and configure databases (MySQL, SQL Server, etc.).
4. Configure firewall with necessary rules.
5. Install SSL Certificates and enforce HTTPS.

### Network and Security Configurations
1. Assign static IPs and configure DNS for web and API access.
2. Set up VPN for secure remote management.
3. Create user roles and enable MFA for admin accounts.
4. Install anti-malware software and configure regular scans.
5. Enable logging for system, application, and security events.
6. Set up server performance monitoring and alerts.

### Final Checks
1. Test deployment of applications (Python apps and websites).
2. Validate API security with rate limiting and token management.
3. Confirm backup and restore functionality.
4. Review access controls for authorized management.
5. Conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
